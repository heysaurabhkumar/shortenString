# shortenString
##Design an algorithm which shortens a string into a shorter string. Write this function in JS. \  
1. It is given that input strings are alphabets only and provided in small case only (for eg starwars). This should get shortened to something smaller (output can be alphanumeric) \  2. The shortening algorithm should be non-conflicting, i.e. no 2 different input strings should result in same shortened output string. \
3. Also write the reverse operation, if I enter a shortened string, it can decode and provide the original full string.
